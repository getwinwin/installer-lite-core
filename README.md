# WinWin Installer Lite (Core)

Welcome to WinWin Installer Lite. The Core edition means that we do not include the complete package, but only a simplified modified core of the WinWin Installer.

## Examples

```
// Install WinWin Activator

Install("WinWin Activator", @"C:\Program Files\WinWin\Activator", "https://cdn.lottamo.com/winwin/WinWin.exe", "WinWin.exe");
```

## Requirements

Acutally, you don't really need to import anything other than the code. But I wouldn't reccomend using this software if you don't already know C# pretty well.

## To-Do

* Add option for asynchronous installation
* Add progress bar
* Publish GUI
* Build more advanced GUI
